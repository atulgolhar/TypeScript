START AGAIN

FILE STRUCTURE			so we add javascript right inside main.ts TypeScript file

index.html
main.ts 			add code 		let username = 'Dave'
							console.log(username) 

need to compile main.js
how? run main.ts from terminal inside VSCode			00.06.37
$ tsc main.ts		// this compiles javascript file from typescript tile
			// now both main.js and main.ts are open and get error blocked scope variable
			// thus close file main.js file the error goes away
ATUL so always working in TypeScript and let main.ts TypeScript compile the JavaScript file

Load DOM before loading JavaScript

$ tsc main.ts -w		// watch ts file for any changes, then automatically recompile js file
v 00.10.10
this works only when working with 1 file
but on large projects, many updates occur, so would need to recompile the ts file each time
Unreasonable, so add -w watch flag
CNTL C to exit typescript from terminal window
No Folders at this point
Typical project would have a source folder and build folder
Create 2 new folders 		scr 	build			v00.10.40
Build folder holds 
- compiled code so typically have index.html inside build folder
- css folder inside build folder
- js folder inside build folder
Raw code like typescript inside src folder
How to get typescript to understand that all of our main files are in the source directory and then
also compile those file and put them inside the build directory and even inside the js subfolder inside 
the build directory.
Lets put index.html inside the build folder		ATUL move index.hmtl inside build folder
Delete the js file					ATUL delete the main.js file at top level
Move main.ts to inside src folder
So now folder structure is two files		build folder	src folder	
						index.html	main.ts

So left with two folders only 		build folder	src folder
Then later we will have a nested directory inside build folder named js folder
Close terminal window, so only VS Code window is open
Open new terminal window 	CNTRL SHIFT ` BACKTIC
ATUL notice that terminal window opens inside VSCode
Need to create tsconfig.json file 	How? in terminal type $ tsc --init
$ tsc --init		which creates tsconfig.json file at top level 

=========
PS C:\Users\agolh\Desktop\04Project_TypeScript8hr\01_StartHere> tsc --init

Created a new tsconfig.json with:                                                                                       
                                                                                                                     TS 
  target: es2016
  module: commonjs
  strict: true
  esModuleInterop: true
  skipLibCheck: true
  forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true
